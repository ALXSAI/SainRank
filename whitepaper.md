# Anonymous Blockchain Verification Algorithm: SainRank

## Abstract

This white paper introduces SainRank, an innovative algorithm designed to verify the performance and trustworthiness of blockchain wallets anonymously. By recursively analyzing transaction histories of both the target wallet and its transaction partners, SainRank provides a comprehensive trust score without compromising user privacy. This algorithm draws inspiration from Google's PageRank while incorporating blockchain-specific metrics to ensure relevance and accuracy in the decentralized finance ecosystem. SainRank aims to enhance security, reduce fraud, and increase confidence in blockchain transactions across various applications.

## 1. Introduction

As blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) continue to revolutionize the financial landscape, the need for reliable, privacy-preserving methods to assess wallet trustworthiness becomes increasingly critical. Traditional centralized systems often rely on personal identification and credit scores, which are incompatible with the pseudonymous nature of blockchain networks. SainRank addresses this need by offering an anonymous verification mechanism based on transaction history analysis.

### 1.1 Background

The rapid growth of cryptocurrencies and DeFi platforms has led to an increase in fraudulent activities and scams. Users and platforms alike require a method to evaluate the reliability of potential transaction partners without compromising the fundamental principles of blockchain technology, such as privacy and decentralization.

### 1.2 Objectives

The primary objectives of SainRank are:
1. To provide a trustworthiness score for blockchain wallets without revealing personal information
2. To incorporate multiple relevant metrics specific to blockchain transactions
3. To offer a scalable solution that can adapt to various blockchain networks and use cases
4. To enhance overall security and confidence in the blockchain ecosystem

## 2. Algorithm Overview

SainRank employs a recursive approach to analyze wallet behavior, drawing inspiration from the PageRank algorithm while incorporating blockchain-specific considerations.

### 2.1 Core Concept

The fundamental idea behind SainRank is that a wallet's trustworthiness is influenced not only by its own transaction history but also by the trustworthiness of the wallets it interacts with. This concept mirrors the way PageRank assesses the importance of web pages based on their incoming links.

### 2.2 Algorithmic Steps

1. Start with a target wallet
2. Analyze the target's transaction history
3. Recursively examine transaction histories of wallets interacting with the target
4. Apply a weighting system based on depth of recursion
5. Combine metrics to produce a final trust score

### 2.3 Mathematical Representation

The SainRank score T(w) for a wallet w can be represented as:

T(w) = α * D(w) + (1 - α) * Σ(T(v) * W(v,w))

Where:
- α is a damping factor (typically set between 0.1 and 0.2)
- D(w) is the direct trust score based on w's own transaction history
- T(v) is the SainRank score of a wallet v that interacts with w
- W(v,w) is the weight of the interaction between v and w

## 3. Key Metrics

SainRank considers the following metrics to calculate the direct trust score D(w):

### 3.1 Transaction Volume

The total value of cryptocurrencies transferred through the wallet over a specific period. This metric helps identify wallets with significant economic activity.

### 3.2 Number of Transactions

The frequency of transactions provides insight into the wallet's activity level and can help distinguish between regularly used wallets and potentially dormant or suspicious ones.

### 3.3 Transaction Direction

The ratio of inbound to outbound transactions can reveal patterns that may indicate the wallet's primary use (e.g., trading, holding, or distributing funds).

### 3.4 Time Delta Between Transaction Bursts

### 3.4.1 Burst Analysis

The algorithm calculates the average of the largest 5% delta times between transactions to identify patterns of activity and potential anomalies. This approach helps detect:
- Regular usage patterns
- Sudden spikes in activity that may indicate suspicious behavior
- Long periods of inactivity followed by rapid transactions

### 3.4.2 Implementation

1. Sort all time deltas between consecutive transactions in descending order
2. Select the top 5% of these deltas
3. Calculate the average of the selected deltas

This metric provides insights into the wallet's transaction rhythm and can help identify unusual patterns that may require further scrutiny.

### 3.5 Blacklist Status

The algorithm cross-references wallets against known blacklists to identify and penalize potentially malicious actors. This integration adds an extra layer of security by incorporating external threat intelligence.

## 4. Recursive Depth and Weighting

### 4.1 Depth of Recursion

SainRank initiates at a predetermined depth, typically set between 3 and 5 levels. This depth can be adjusted based on the specific use case and computational resources available.

### 4.2 Weighting System

Transaction weights decrease at each lower level of recursion according to the following formula:

W(l) = β^l

Where:
- W(l) is the weight at recursion level l
- β is the base factor (typically set between 0.7 and 0.9)
- l is the current recursion level (0 for the target wallet)

This approach ensures that wallets closer to the target have a more significant impact on the final trust score while still considering the broader network of interactions.

## 5. Duplicate Wallet Handling

To prevent artificial rating inflation and potential manipulation, SainRank implements a first-occurrence policy for wallet consideration.

### 5.1 First-Occurrence Policy

Wallets are only considered at the first level of recursion they appear in, eliminating the possibility of cyclic dependencies and ensuring that each wallet's influence is counted only once.

### 5.2 Implementation

1. Maintain a set of processed wallets
2. Before analyzing a wallet at any recursion level, check if it's already in the set
3. If the wallet is not in the set, add it and proceed with analysis
4. If the wallet is already in the set, skip it and move to the next wallet

This approach prevents malicious actors from creating circular transaction patterns to artificially boost their trust scores.

## 6. Advantages Over PageRank

While inspired by PageRank, SainRank offers several advantages specifically tailored for blockchain ecosystems:

### 6.1 Privacy-Preserving

SainRank operates without revealing personal information, maintaining the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions. This feature is crucial for preserving user privacy and adhering to the core principles of blockchain technology.

### 6.2 Blockchain-Specific Metrics

Unlike PageRank, which primarily considers link structures, SainRank incorporates metrics specifically relevant to cryptocurrency transactions. This tailored approach ensures that the trust scores accurately reflect the unique characteristics of blockchain wallet behavior.

### 6.3 Dynamic Weighting

The algorithm adapts to the depth of recursion, allowing for a more nuanced assessment of trust based on the proximity of interactions. This dynamic weighting system provides a more accurate representation of a wallet's trustworthiness within its immediate and extended network.

### 6.4 Blacklist Awareness

By incorporating known risk factors through blacklist integration, SainRank adds an extra layer of security that is particularly relevant in the blockchain space, where fraudulent activities and scams are ongoing concerns.

## 7. Potential Applications

SainRank has the potential to enhance security and trust across various blockchain-based applications:

### 7.1 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Platforms
